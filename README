## Getting Started

### Instalation
Download SNPtools using the [online guide](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/snptest/#download). 

### Set up
Correct the absolute path's in min_model/scripts and max_model/scripts. This includes changing the path to your input file and the absolute path to your install of SNPtools. The lines that need to be changed are marked in the file.
Add the list of CpG islands you would like to run SNP tools on. Make sure the name matches the column name of the input file. This file should be saved as "CpG_pheno.txt", and formated like the example bellow
````
phenotype
cg00000
cg00001
cg00002
...
````
